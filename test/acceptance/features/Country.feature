    # Scenario: Choosing sole trader legal status
    #     Given I open the url "/water/country"
    #     And I pause for 500ms
    #     Then I expect that the url contains "/country" 
    #     When I click on the element "#inEngland" 
    #     And I pause for 500ms
    #     When I add "m24 4au" to the inputfield "#projectPostcode" 
    #     When I click on the button "#btnContinue"
    #     And I pause for 500ms
    #     Then I expect that the url contains "/planning-permission"
    #     Then I expect that element "h1" contains the text "Does the project need planning permission?"
