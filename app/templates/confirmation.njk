          <ol>
            <li>
              RPA will be in touch when the full application period opens.
              They will tell you if your project scored well enough to get the full application form.
            </li>
            <br/>

            <li>
              If you submit an application, RPA will assess it against other projects and value for money.
              You will not automatically get a grant.
              The grant is expected to be highly competitive and you are competing against other projects.
            </li>
            <br/>

            <li>
              If your application is successful, you'll be sent a funding agreement and can begin work on the project.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <p>Starting the project or committing to any costs (such as placing orders) before you receive a funding agreement will invalidate your application.</p>
