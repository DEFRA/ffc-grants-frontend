        Starting the project or committing to any costs (such as placing orders) before you receive a funding agreement will invalidate your application.

          <li>get quotes from suppliers</li>
          <li>apply for planning permission or an abstraction licence</li>

        You will not automatically get a grant. The grant is expected to be highly competitive and you are competing against other projects.</div>
