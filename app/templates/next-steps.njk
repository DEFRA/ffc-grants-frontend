        RPA will be in touch when the full application period opens. 
        <br/><br/>
        They will tell you if your project scored well enough to be sent the full application form.
        <br/><br/>
        Value for money will be assessed alongside the funding priorities at full application stage and this may impact your overall project score.
        <br/><br/>
        The likelihood of a full application being successful will also depend on the number and value of applications we receive.

        Starting the project or committing to any costs (such as placing orders) before you receive a funding agreement will invalidate your application.

          <li>get quotes from suppliers</li>

        You will not automatically get a grant. The grant is expected to be highly competitive and you are competing against other projects.</div>
